Heya!
For this course, we're gonna use __*R*__ and __*RStudio*__ quite a bite!
I would consider myself an beginner-to-intermediate R-User. 

However, i haven't worked with __Github/Git__ yet, so it took me a bit to grasp it, but now i guess i understand *commits*, *pushes & pulls*, *branching & merging* etc. 
I am currently using _github desktop_ as client for my offline/remote repositories. Wondering, if there are any better ones, e.g. tower or fork. However, _github_ desktop is working nice for me right now.
Haven't been able to use _git_ with the *command line* only, not really working for me right now on Windows 10, 64x, with Git Bash. Problem seems to be that i can not type an __@__ in Bash and therefore can not link to the online _github_ account. Anybody knows any solution for this?

Ok, so we should also include pics and links. 
So, for example, we can refer to homepages by direct text based links, e.g. [The Comprehensive R Archive Network](https://cran.r-project.org/).
In the same manner, we can refer to images, e.g. [the R Logo](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png).


By adding a __"!"__ *(Exclamation Mark)* before the square brackets and the link, the image will be automatically displayed in the markdown document ![the R Logo](https://www.r-project.org/logo/Rlogo.png).
